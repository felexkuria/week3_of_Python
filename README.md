# Understanding the `if...elif...else` Statement in Python

The `if...elif...else` statement allows you to handle multiple conditions sequentially. Hereâ€™s how it works:

## Structure

- **`if`**: The first condition is checked.
  - If `True`, its code block runs, and the rest are skipped.
  - If `False`, Python moves to the next condition.
- **`elif`** (Short for "else if"):
  - If the previous conditions are `False`, this condition is checked.
  - You can have multiple `elif` blocks for complex logic.
- **`else`**:
  - Acts as the "default" case if all previous conditions fail.

## Example Breakdown

```python
temperature = 15

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a hot day!")      # Block 1
elif temperature > 15:
    print("It's a warm day!")     # Block 2
else:
    print("It's a cold day!")     # Block 3
```
